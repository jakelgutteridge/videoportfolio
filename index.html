<p>Cedars Park is a 16th century historic public park, standing on the original
  site of Theobalds Palace, in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, a leading example of
  Prodigy House architecture and later the favourite residence of King James I.
  As a result, this small local amenity carries significant historical and national heritage value.</p>

<p>Theobalds Palace is regarded as a highly influential Jacobean royal palace and
  one of the most elaborate estates of its time. During the English Civil War,
  the palace was demolished for its materials to support the troops and only remains
  of some walls and outbuildings are extant today.</p>

<p>The modern park is a popular local green space and community hub and includes
  contemporary features in keeping with the history and grounds of the Royal Palace
  that stood here.</p>

    <h2>About the park</h2>
    
    <p>Cedars Park is a small local park with great historical and national heritage value.
      It is the former site of Theobalds Palace, one of the most renowned English
      estates during the Stuart period and King James I's favourite residence, where
      he spent the majority of his later life.
      The palace was demolished in the 17th century and many elements (Scheduled Monuments)
      are still standing.</p>

    <p>Today, the park offers a number of excellent features and is a very popular and accessible green space for
      the people of Cheshunt. You can get an impression from our
      <a href="photos">photo gallery</a>. For opening times,
      please see the <a href="https://broxbourne.gov.uk/cedarspark" target="_blank">Broxbourne Borough Council</a> website.</p>
